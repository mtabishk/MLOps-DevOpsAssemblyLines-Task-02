## Description:
#### 1. Create container image thatâ€™s has Jenkins installed using dockerfile.
#### 2. When we launch this image, it should automatically starts Jenkins service in the container.
#### 3. Create a job chain of job1, job2, job3 and job4 using build pipeline plugin in Jenkins.
#### 4. Job1 : Pull the Github repo automatically when some developers push repo to Github.
#### 5. Job2 : By looking at the code or program file, Jenkins should automatically start the respective language interpreter install image container to deploy code ( eg. If code is of PHP, then Jenkins should start the container that has PHP already installed ).
#### 6. Job3 : Test your app if it is working or not. If app is not working , then send email to developer with error messages.
#### 7. Job4 : If container where app is running. fails due to any reson then this job should automatically start the container again.

### Step1: Git and GitHub
  * Create a repository on GitHub, initialize with read me, and then clone it on your local Git.

### Step2: RedHat OS
  * Run Docker services in your Redhat OS.
  * Create a volume in your redhat os to link with the container afterwards

### Step3:Setup Jenkins Jobs

#### Job1: For fetching repo from GitHub
This job will copy repository from github whenever developer pushes the code to Github. This job has a build trigger Poll SCM enabled in it that will check every minute if there is any update in github.

#### Job2: For launching container
This job is interesting it will check the code/program file then automatically launch container having the respective language interpreter installed in it. This job is also chainnned with Job1. It will run only when Job1 is successfully build.
